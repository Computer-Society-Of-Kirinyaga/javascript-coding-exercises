# The exercises here will help you practice values and variables in JavaScript
**Please don't underrate any question if you are a beginner, repetition is the mother of mastery**

Feel free to create an html file and link it to your JavaScript file to view your outputs in the browser console.

I however  recommend that you use nodeJS which is a JavaScript runtime to run your JavaScript files and view the outputs in the terminal/command prompt, this will help you avoid creating too many html files.

# Exercise 1
Declare variable firstNumber, secondNumber and thirdNumber with the values 89 56 and 98 respectively. Write a JavaScript program that will log to the console the biggest number among the three.
Using the same variables and values, write a program that will log to the console the smallest number among the three.

# Exercise 2
Write a program using a for loop to list all numbers divisible by 5 between 1 and 300. Your loop must increment with one and should use an if statement to check those numbers that are divisible by 5.

# Exercise 3
An even number is any number that is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. Write a program that lists all even numbers between 1 and 300 in the fashion below. Your program should use a while loop and the while loop should be updated by 1, your program must also use an if statement to check these even numbers.
2 is an even number
4 is an even number
6 is an even number
...
300 is an even number.

# Exercise 4
An odd number is a number that is not divisible by 2. Write a program that lists all odd numbers between 1 and 300 in the fashion below. Your program should use a for loop and should be updated by 1 in each iteration of the for loop.
3 is an odd number.
5 is an odd number.
etc

# Exercise 5
Rectangle A has a width of 25 centimeters and a height of 30 centimeters, rectangle B on the other hand has a width of 30 centimeters and a height of 20 centimeters, write a program that will log to the console which rectangle is the biggest. For example
Rectangle A is bigger than rectangle B. Or
Rectangle B is bigger than rectangle A.

# Exercise 6: whiteboarding and critical thinking
A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. Write a program that lists all prime numbers between 1 and 300.
For this problem, try to whiteboard your ideas first before you start coding.

# Exercise 7
A citizen is viable for voting if he or she is 18 years and above, if sally is 16 years old, write a javascript program that will log to the console "you are viable for voting" if she is 18 years and above, otherwise, the program should log to the console how many more years she should wait before voting eg "Please wait 5 more years to start voting".

# Exercise 8
A school's grading system is as follows
80 - 100 -> A
70 -  79 -> B
50 -  69 -> C
40 -  49 -> D
0  -  39 -> supplementary
A student taking 5 units scores 60, 67, 89, 23, 52.
Write a program that will find his average and log to the console his grade.

# Exercise 9: INTERVIEW QUESTION - FizzBuzz - WHITEBOARD FIRST
Write a program that lists the numbers between 1 and 300 as follows
If the number is divisible by 3, instead of printing the number print "Fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, instead of printing the number print "Buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, istead of printing the number print "FizzBuzz".
If the number is not divisible by 3 and 5 or both of them eg number 7, print the number itself.
