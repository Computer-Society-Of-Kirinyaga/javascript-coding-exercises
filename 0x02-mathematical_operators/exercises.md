# The exercises here will help you practice mathematical operators
**Please don't underrate any question if you are a beginner, repetition is the mother of mastery**

Feel free to create an html file and link it to your JavaScript file to view your outputs in the browser console.

I however  recommend that you use nodeJS which is a JavaScript runtime to run your JavaScript files and view the outputs in the terminal/command prompt, this will help you avoid creating too many html files.

## *For these exercises, don't hard code anything, use variables to store your values and do the calculations where needed*

## Exercise 1
Log the following to the console

- The product of 3 and 5
- The square of the digit 5
- The cube of 8
- The difference between 23 and 5
- 8 divided by 3
- The sum of 5 and 5

## Exercise 2
A rectangle has a width 8 and a height of 5, declare a variable to hold the width and another variable to hold the height, declare a third variable to hold the area and the fourth one to hold the perimeter.

Log to the console the area and the perimeter of this rectangle.

Log to the console the difference between the area and perimter
#### Example: Area: 900. Perimter: 200. Difference between area and perimeter: 700

## Exercise 3
Rectangle A has a width 9 and a height of 5, Rectangle B has a width of 6 and a height of 7.

You have to declare a variable to hold the width of rectangle A as well as its height, declare the third variable to hold the area, do the same for rectangle B, declare a variable for the area difference and assign it a value of rectangle A area minus rectangle B area and log these results to the console.

## Exercise 4
A circle has a radius of 14, find the area and circumference of this circle.

Don't forget the fact that pi is a constant (value is 3.1427).

Log to the console the area of the circle, the circumference of the circle and the difference between the area and the circumference of the circle.

## Exercise 5
Jane has 25 years old, given the fact that her dad is twice her age plus 8 and her mum is 6 years younger than her dad:

Declare variables to hold Jane's age, her dad's age and her mum's age

Log to the console the age of her dad and the age of her mum as well.

What is the difference between her mum's age and her age, log it to the console.

## Exercise 6
There are x cows in a farm, the number of sheep in the farm is 10 less that of cows, if there are 15 sheep, log to the console the number of cows.

## Exercise 7
If a cuboid has a length of 8, a breadth of 15 and a height of 22:

Find the volume of this cuboid

Find the surface area of this cuboid

## Exercise 8
The discoung of an item is 15% of the original prize, if the original prize is ksh.800, write a program that will log to the console the purchase price.

## Exercise 9: Advanced
Write a blog about mathematical operators in JavaScript, make sure to discuss about operator precedence in your blog.
