# The exercises here will help you practice values and variables in JavaScript
**Please don't underrate any question if you are a beginner, repetition is the mother of mastery**

Feel free to create an html file and link it to your JavaScript file to view your outputs in the browser console.

I however  recommend that you use nodeJS which is a JavaScript runtime to run your JavaScript files and view the outputs in the terminal/command prompt, this will help you avoid creating too many html files.

## Exercise 1
Declare a variable called myName and initialize its value to be your name.

Log the value of the variable myName to the console.

## Exercise 2
Declare a variable called myName2 and initialize its value to your name.

Log to the console the string "My name is {your_name}" where your_name is the value of the variable myName2 that you initialized.

Sample output: My name is Zaphenath Paneah

## Exercise 3
Declare a constant called pi with the value 3.142

Log to the console the value of pi.

## Exercise 4
Declare a variable called firstName with your first name as the value.

Declare another variable secondName with your second name as the value.

Log to the console the string "My first name is {your_first_name} and my second name is {your_second_name}"
 where your_first_name is the value of the firstName variable and your_second_name is the value of the secondName variable.
#### Example: My first name is Zaphenath and my second name is Paneah

## Exercise 5
Declare a constant called playerHeight and initialize it with the value 1.8.

Declare another constant called playerName and initialize it with the value "Cristiano Ronaldo".

Declare another constant called playerRole and initialize it with the value "Striker".

Lastly, declare another constant called playerStrength and initialize it with the value "Speed".

Log these results to the console in the format below.
#### Name: {player name here}
#### Height: {player height}
#### Role: {player role}
#### Strength: {player strength}

## Exercise 6: Advanced - Technical Writing

## Write a blog about values and variables in JavaScript. _(Use medium or any other blogging site)_

Talk about what a value is and what a variable is and the difference between the two, talk about constants in your blog, don't forget to give code examples in your blog, discuss the rules for naming variables and good practices when naming JavaScript variables, don't forget to discuss the importance of variables as a fundamental programming concept.
#### Make sure your blog starts with an image - this is not compulsory but just do it, (research on yourself why bloggers do this.)
